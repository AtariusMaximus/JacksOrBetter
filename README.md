You start the game with 160 coins displayed in the bottom middle of the screen ($40 in quarters!).  You can play until you run out of coins.  At the top of the screen your credits are displayed, the object is to get as many credits as you can with the 160 credits you start with.  If you wind up with more than 160, you're doing great!

When you start the game, you first need to make your bet.  You can bet up to four coins at once, and the payouts are highlighted at the top of the screen.  After the initial draw, you can't change your bet.  With the "Bet" button highlighted, press the fire button to cycle between 1-4 coins per hand.  Once you've chosen your bet, push right and push the fire button with "Draw" highlighted.  5 cards will be presented.  Here you can choose to hold or drop each card.  Select HOLD with the left fire button and DROP with the right fire button.  After you have made your choices, push down to go back to the "Draw" button and push fire.  Your hand will be analyzed for a win.  After winning or losing that hand, the "New Hand" button will be highlighted.  Push fire to start with 5 new cards.
